    <ul align="left">
        <li>Remember, these are just suggestions. Babies are different and can fall below or above these ranges.</li>
        <li>Your child may have higher or lower wake time needs. Consult with your pediatrician in matters related to your child's health. </li>
        <li>Waketimes start off on the shorter end and increase a bit as the day progresses.</li>
        <li>Waketimes mean total wake time (starting when baby awakes).</li>
        <li>If your baby was born more than 3 weeks early, use babyâ€™s adjusted age when following wake times.</li>
        <li>Sample waketime schedules are given for children from 3 to 12 months.</li>
        <li>Slashes in sample schedules indicate naps. Waketimes are given in hours. So 0.25 is 15 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
